Recently, the result of the trial of Liu Qiangdong, the president of Jingdong Enterprise, was released. As far as the rape case involving Liu Qiangdong was concerned, it caused a lot of public distrust of Jingdong Company. Jingdongâ€™s share price also plummeted. As far as this matter is concerned, I believe that as the president of a large company, it needs to have a sense of social responsibility and crisis. The quality of its own behavior can greatly affect the company's reputation.
